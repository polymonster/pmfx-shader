# pmfx-shader  

[![tests](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/actions/workflows/tests.yaml)[![release](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/actions/workflows/release.yaml)  

A cross platform shader language with multi-threaded offline compilation or platform shader source code generation. Output json reflection info and c++ header with your shaders structs, fx-like techniques and compile time branch evaluation via (uber-shader) "permutations". Version 1.0 is now in maintenence mode and Version 2.0 is in progress which aims to offer wider support for more modern GPU features.

## Supported Targets

- HLSL Shader Model 6 (pmfx -v2)
- HLSL Shader Model 3+
- GLSL 330+
- GLES 300+ (WebGL 2.0)
- GLSL 200 (compatibility)
- GLES (WebGL 1.0) (compatibility)
- SPIR-V. (Vulkan, OpenGL)
- Metal 1.0+ (macOS, iOS, tvOS)
- PSSL
- NVN (Nintendo Switch)

(compatibility) platforms for older hardware might not support all pmfx features and may have missing legacy features.

## Dependencies

Windows users need [vcredist 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=40784) for the glsl/spirv validator.

## Console Platforms

Compilation for Orbis but you will need the SDK's installed and the environment variables set.

For NVN there is an [executable](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/tree/master/bin/nvn) included to compile to `nvn_glsc` but it will reuire the `NvnGlslc32.dll` to be installed along with the SDK.

## Usage

You can use from source by cloning this repository and build `pmfx.py`, or install the latest packaged [release](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/releases) if you do not need access to the source code.

## Versions

There are 2 code paths supported by pmfx, this in an effort to keep up-to-date with moder graphics API's but also offer backward comptibility support to older graphics API's, mobile and web platforms.

- [Version 1](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader#version-1) - (bindful render model, techniques, macro based cross platform shaders)
- [Version 2](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader#version-2) - (bindless render model, descriptor sets, pipelines, SPIR-V based cross-compilation)

## Version 1

Compile with the `-v1` flag to select version 1.

A single file does all the shader parsing and code generation. Simple syntax changes are handled through macros and defines found in [platform](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/tree/master/platform), so it is simple to add new features or change things to behave how you like. More complex differences between shader languages are handled through code-generation.  

This is a small part of the larger [pmfx](https://github.com/polymonster/pmtech/wiki/Pmfx) system found in [pmtech](https://github.com/polymonster/pmtech), it has been moved into a separate repository to be used with other projects, if you are interested to see how pmfx shaders are integrated please take a look [here](https://github.com/polymonster/pmtech).

### Compiling Examples

Take a look at the example [code](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/tree/master/examples/v1).

```text
// metal macos
python3 pmfx.py -v1 -shader_platform metal -metal_sdk macosx -metal_min_os 10.14 -shader_version 2.2 -i examples/v1 -o output/bin -h output/structs -t output/temp

// metal ios
python3 pmfx.py -v1 -shader_platform metal -metal_sdk iphoneos -metal_min_os 0.9 -shader_version 2.2 -i examples/v1 -o output/bin -h output/structs -t output/temp

// spir-v vulkan
python3 pmfx.py -v1 -shader_platform spirv -i examples/v1 -o output/bin -h output/structs -t output/temp

// hlsl d3d11
python3 pmfx.py -v1 -shader_platform hlsl -shader_version 4_0 -i examples/v1 -o output/bin -h output/structs -t output/temp

// glsl
python3 pmfx.py -v1 -shader_platform glsl -shader_version 330 -i examples/v1 -o output/bin -h output/structs -t output/temp

// gles
python3 pmfx.py -v1 -shader_platform gles -shader_version 320 -i examples/v1 -o output/bin -h output/structs -t output/temp
```

### Version 1 shader language  

Use mostly HLSL syntax for shaders, with some small differences:

#### Always use structs for inputs and outputs  

```hlsl
struct vs_input
{
    float4 position : POSITION;
};

struct vs_output
{
    float4 position : SV_POSITION0;
};

vs_output vs_main( vs_input input )
{
    vs_output output;
    
    output.position = input.position;
    
    return output;
}
```

#### Supported semantics and sizes

pmfx will generate an input layout for you in the json reflection info, containing the stride of the vertex layout and the byte offsets to each of the elements. If you choose to use this, pmfx will assume the following sizes for semantics:

```hlsl
POSITION     // 32bit float
TEXCOORD     // 32bit float
NORMAL       // 32bit float
TANGENT      // 32bit float
BITANGENT    // 32bit float
BLENDWEIGHTS // 32bit float
COLOR        // 8bit unsigned int
BLENDINDICES // 8bit unsigned int
```

#### Shader resources

Due to fundamental differences accross shader languages, shader resource declarations and access have a syntax unique to pmfx. Define a block of shader_resources to allow global textures or buffers as supported in HLSL and GLSL.

```c
shader_resources
{
    texture_2d( diffuse_texture, 0 );
    texture_2dms( float4, 2, texture_msaa_2, 0 );
};
```

#### Resource types

```c
// cbuffers are the same as regular hlsl
cbuffer per_view : register(b0)
{
    float4x4 view_matrix;
};

// texture types
texture_2d( sampler_name, layout_index );
texture_2dms( type, samples, sampler_name, layout_index );
texture_2d_array( sampler_name, layout_index );
texture_cube( sampler_name, layout_index );
texture_cube_array( sampler_name, layout_index ); // requires sm 4+, gles 400+
texture_3d( sampler_name, layout_index );
texture_2d_external( sampler_name, layout_index ); // gles specific extension

// depth formats are required for sampler compare ops
depth_2d( sampler_name, layout_index ); 
depth_2d_array( sampler_name, layout_index );
depth_cube( sampler_name, layout_index ); 
depth_cube_array( sampler_name, layout_index );

// compute shader texture types
texture_2d_r( image_name, layout_index );
texture_2d_w( image_name, layout_index );
texture_2d_rw( image_name, layout_index );
texture_3d_r( image_name, layout_index );
texture_3d_w( image_name, layout_index );
texture_3d_rw( image_name, layout_index );
texture_2d_array_r( image_name, layout_index );
texture_2d_array_w( image_name, layout_index );
texture_2d_array_rw( image_name, layout_index );

// compute shader buffer types
structured_buffer( type, name, index );
structured_buffer_rw( type, name, index );
atomic_counter(name, index);

// bindless resouce tables
// name, type, dimension, register, space
texture2d_table(texture0, float4, [], 0, 0);
cbuffer_table(constant_buffer0, data, [], 1, 0);
sampler_state_table(sampler0, [], 0);

// smapler type
sampler_state(sampler0, 0);
```

#### Accessing resources

Textures and samplers are combined when using a binding renderer model. a `texture_2d` declares a texture and a sampler on the corresponding texture and sampler register index which is passed into the macro. The `sample_texture` can be used to sample textures of varying dimensions.

```c
// sample texture
float4 col = sample_texture( diffuse_texture, texcoord.xy );
float4 cube = sample_texture( cubemap_texture, normal.xyz );
float4 msaa_sample = sample_texture_2dms( msaa_texture, x, y, fragment );
float4 level = sample_texture_level( texture, texcoord.xy, mip_level);
float4 array = sample_texture_array( texture, texcoord.xy, array_slice);
float4 array_level = sample_texture_array_level( texture, texcoord.xy, array_slice, mip_level);

// sample compare
float shadow = sample_depth_compare( shadow_map, texcoord.xy, compare_ref);
float shadow_array = sample_depth_compare_array( shadow_map, texcoord.xy, array_slice, compare_ref);
float cube_shadow = sample_depth_compare_cube( shadow_map, texcoord.xyz, compare_ref);
float cube_shadow_array = sample_depth_compare_cube_array( shadow_map, texcoord.xyz, array_slice, compare_ref);

// compute rw texture
float4 rwtex = read_texture( tex_rw, gid );
write_texture(rwtex, val, gid);

// compute structured buffer
struct val = structured_buffer[gid]; // read
structured_buffer[gid] = val;        // write

// read type!
// glsl expects ivec (int) to be pass to imageLoad, hlsl and metal require uint... 
// there is a `read` type you can use to be platform safe
read3 read_coord = read3(x, y, z);
read_texture( tex_rw, read_coord );
```

### Atomic Operations

Support for glsl, hlsl and metal compatible atomics and memory barriers is available. The atomic_counter resource type is a RWStructuredBuffer<uint> in hlsl, a atomic_uint read/write buffer in Metal and a uniform atomic_uint in GLSL.

```hlsl
// types
atomic_uint u;
atomic_int i;

// operations
atomic_load(atomic, original)
atomic_store(atomic, value)
atomic_increment(atomic, original)
atomic_decrement(atomic, original)
atomic_add(atomic, value, original)
atomic_subtract(atomic, value, original)
atomic_min(atomic, value, original)
atomic_max(atomic, value, original)
atomic_and(atomic, value, original)
atomic_or(atomic, value, original)
atomic_xor(atomic, value, original)
atomic_exchange(atomic, value, original)
threadgroup_barrier()
device_barrier()

// usage
shader_resources
{
    atomic_counter(counter, 0); // counter bound to index 0
}

// increments counter and stores the original value in 'index'
uint index = 0;
atomic_increment(counter, index);
```

#### Includes

Include files are supported even though some shader platforms or versions may not support them natively.

```c
#include "libs/lighting.pmfx"
#include "libs/skinning.pmfx"
#include "libs/globals.pmfx"
#include "libs/sdf.pmfx"
#include "libs/area_lights.pmfx"
```

#### Extensions

To enable glsl extensions you can pass a list of strings to the `-extensions` commandline argument. The glsl extension will be inserted to the top of the generated code with `: require` set:

```text
-extensions GL_OES_EGL_image_external GL_OES_get_program_binary
```

## Unique pmfx features

### GLES 2.0 / GLSL 2.0 cbuffers

cbuffers are emulated for older glsl versions, a cbuffer is packed into a single float4 array. The uniform float4 array (`glUniform4fv`) is named after the cbuffer, you can find the uniform location from this name using `glUniformLocation`. The count of the float4 array is the number of members the cbuffer where float4 and float4x4 are supported and float4x4 count for 4 array elements. You can use the generated c++ structs from pmfx to create a coherent copy of the uniform data on the cpu. GLES 2.0 / GLSL 2.0 cbuffers

cbuffers are emulated for older glsl versions, a cbuffer is packed into a single float4 array. The uniform float4 array (`glUniform4fv`) is named after the cbuffer, you can find the uniform location from this name using `glUniformLocation`. The count of the float4 array is the number of members the cbuffer where float4 and float4x4 are supported and float4x4 count for 4 array elements. You can use the generated c++ structs from pmfx to create a coherent copy of the uniform data on the cpu.

### cbuffer_offset / texture_offset

HLSL has different registers for textures, vertex buffers, cbuffers and un-ordered access views. Metal and Vulkan have some differences where the register indices are shared across different resource types. To avoid collisions in different API backends you can supply offsets using the following command line options.

Metal: -cbuffer_offset (cbuffers start binding at this offset to allow vertex buffers to be bound to the slots prior to these offsets)

Vulkan: -texture_offset (textures start binding at this point allowing uniform buffers to bind to the prior slots)

### v_flip

OpenGL has different viewport co-ordinates to texture coordinate so when rendering to the backbuffer vs rendering into a render target you can get output results that are flipped in the y-axis, this can propagate it's way far into a code base with conditional "v_flips" happening during different render passes.

To solve this issue in a cross platform way, pmfx will expose a uniform bool called "v_flip" in all gl vertex shaders, this allows you to conditionally flip the y-coordinate when rendering to the backbuffer or not.  

To make this work make sure you also change the winding glFrontFace(GL_CCW) to glFrontFace(GL_CW).

### cbuffer padding

HLSL/Direct3D requires cbuffers to be padded to 16 bytes alignment, pmfx allows you to create cbuffers with any size and will pad the rest out for you.

### Techniques

Single .pmfx file can contain multiple shader functions so you can share functionality, you can define a block of [jsn](https://github.com/polymonster/jsn) in the shader to configure techniques. (jsn is a more lenient and user friendly data format similar to json).

Simply specify `vs`, `ps` or `cs` to select which function in the source to use for that shader stage. If no pmfx: json block is found you can still supply `vs_main` and `ps_main` which will be output as a technique named "default".

```jsonnet
pmfx:
{    
    gbuffer: {
        vs: vs_main
        ps: ps_gbuffer
    }
        
    zonly: {
        vs: vs_main_zonly
        ps: ps_null
    }
}
```

You can also use json to specify technique constants with range and ui type.. so you can later hook them into a gui:

```jsonnet
constants:
{
    albedo: { 
        type: float4, widget: colour, default: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
    }
    roughness: { 
        type: float, widget: slider, min: 0, max: 1, default: 0.5
    }
    reflectivity: { 
        type: float, widget: slider, min: 0, max: 1, default: 0.3
    }
}
```

![pmfx constants](https://github.com/polymonster/polymonster.github.io/raw/master/assets/wiki/pmfx-material.png)

Access to technique constants is done with m_prefix.

```hlsl
ps_output ps_main(vs_output input)
{
    float4 col = m_albedo;
}
```

### Permutations

Permutations provide an uber shader style compile time branch evaluation to generate optimal shaders but allowing for flexibility to share code as much as possible. The pmfx block is used here again, you can specify permutations inside a technique.

```yaml
permutations:
{
    SKINNED: [31, [0,1]]
    INSTANCED: [30, [0,1]]
    UV_SCALE: [1, [0,1]]
}
```

The first parameter is a bit shift that we can check.. so skinned is 1<<31 and uv scale is 1<<1. The second value is number of options, so in the above example we just have on or off, but you could have a quality level 0-5 for instance.

To insert a compile time evaluated branch in code, use a colon after if / else

```c++
if:(SKINNED)
{
    float4 sp = skin_pos(input.position, input.blend_weights, input.blend_indices);
    output.position = mul( sp, vp_matrix );
}
else:
{
    output.position = mul( input.position, wvp );
}
```

For each permutation a shader is generated with the technique plus the permutation id. The id is generated from the values passed in the permutation object.

Adding permutations can cause the number of generated shaders to grow exponentially, pmfx will detect redundant shader combinations using md5 hashing, to re-use duplicate permutation combinations and avoid un-necessary compilation.

### C++ Header

After compilation a header is output for each .pmfx file containing c struct declarations for the cbuffers, technique constant buffers and vertex inputs. You can use these sturcts to fill buffers in your c++ code and use sizeof for buffer update calls in your graphics api.  

It also contains defines for the shader permutation id / flags that you can check and test against to select the correct shader permutations for a draw call (ie. skinned, instanced, etc).

```c++
namespace debug
{
    struct per_pass_view
    {
        float4x4 view_projection_matrix;
        float4x4 view_matrix;
    };
    struct per_pass_view_2d
    {
        float4x4 projection_matrix;
        float4 user_data;
    };
    #define OMNI_SHADOW_SKINNED 2147483648
    #define OMNI_SHADOW_INSTANCED 1073741824
    #define FORWARD_LIT_SKINNED 2147483648
    #define FORWARD_LIT_INSTANCED 1073741824
    #define FORWARD_LIT_UV_SCALE 2
    #define FORWARD_LIT_SSS 4
    #define FORWARD_LIT_SDF_SHADOW 8
}
```

A full example output c++ header can be viewed [here](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/blob/master/examples/outputs/v1_header.json).

### JSON Reflection Info

Each .pmfx file comes along with a json file containing reflection info. This info contains the locations textures / buffers are bound to, the size of structs, vertex layout description and more, at this point please remember the output reflection info is fully compliant json, and not lightweight jsn.. this is because of the more widespread support of json.

```json
"texture_sampler_bindings": [
    {
        "name": "gbuffer_albedo",
        "data_type": "float4",
        "fragments": 1,
        "type": "texture_2d",
        "unit": 0
    }]
   
"vs_inputs": [
    {
        "name": "position",
        "semantic_index": 0,
        "semantic_id": 1,
        "size": 16,
        "element_size": 4,
        "num_elements": 4,
        "offset": 0
    }]
```

You can take a look at a full example output file included with this repositiory [here](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/blob/master/examples/outputs/v1_info.json).

## Version 2

Version 2 is currently work in progress, currently only HLSL is the only supported platform, others will become available via SPIRV-cross and DXC. Newer GPU features such as mesh shaders and ray tracing will become available in future too.

Use `.hlsl` files and hlsl source code, create a `.pmfx` which can create pipelines from small amount of meta data:

```jsonnet
import other_files.pmfx
{
    // include shader source files
    include: [
        "imdraw.hlsl"
    ]

    // create pipelines
    pipelines: {
        imdraw_2d: {
            vs: vs_2d
            ps: ps_main
            push_constants: ["view_push_constants"]
            topology: "LineList"
        }
    }
}
```

Pipeline states can be specified and included in `.pmfx` files:

```jsonnet
depth_stencil_states: {
    depth_test_less: {
        depth_enabled: true
        depth_write_mask: All
        depth_func: Less
    }
}
raster_states: {
    wireframe: {
        fill_mode: Wireframe
        depth_bias: -5
    }
    cull_back: {
        cull_mode: Back
    }
}
pipelines: {
    imdraw_mesh: {
        depth_stencil_state: "depth_test_less"
    }
}
```

You can specify textures or render targets:

```jsonnet
textures: {
    main_colour: {
        ratio: {
            window: "main_window",
            scale: 1.0
        }
        format: RGBA8n
        usage: [ShaderResource, RenderTarget]
        samples: 8
    }
    main_depth(main_colour): {
        format: D24nS8u
        usage: [ShaderResource, DepthStencil]
    }
}
```

You can `views` that can act as a render pass with custom data, you can extend these objects to contain custom data such as cameras or render functions to hook into your own engines or entity component systems:

```jsonnet
views: {
    main_view: {
        render_target: [
            "main_colour"
        ]
        clear_colour: [0.45, 0.55, 0.60, 1.0]
        depth_stencil: [
            "main_depth"
        ]
        clear_depth: 1.0
        viewport: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
        camera: "main_camera"
    }
    main_view_no_clear(main_view): {
        clear_colour: null
        clear_depth: null
    }
}
```

`render_graphs` can be used to supply a collection of views with dependencies which can then be used to generate execution order and resource state transitions.

```jsonnet
render_graphs: {
    mesh_debug: {
        grid: {
            view: "main_view"
            pipelines: ["imdraw_3d"]
            function: "render_grid"
        }
        meshes: {
            view: "main_view_no_clear"
            pipelines: ["mesh_debug"]
            function: "render_meshes"
            depends_on: ["grid"]
        }
        wireframe: {
            view: "main_view_no_clear"
            pipelines: ["wireframe_overlay"]
            function: "render_meshes"
            depends_on: ["meshes", "grid"]
        }
    }
}
```

`pmfx` supplies a framework and a schema to configure render state, it will still be down to you to implement that data in a graphics API or engine. If you want to take a look at an example project of how to use these features my graphics engine [hotline](https://github.com/polymonster/hotline) implemenents the feature set and utilises [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) to deserialise the output `json` directly into rust structures.  

Full [documentation](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/blob/master/docs/v2.pmfx_doc) for pipeline specification is provided.

### Building

Compilation is simple with command line args as so:

```text
pmfx.py -shader_platform hlsl -shader_version 6_0 -i src/shaders/ -o ${data_dir}/shaders -t ${temp_dir}/shaders -source
```  

### Examples

Take a look at the example [code](https://github.com/polymonster/pmfx-shader/tree/master/examples/v2).

### Output

Compiled shaders and reflection information will be emitted to your chosen `-o` outout directory, Each `.pmfx` file will create a directory which it will compile shader binaries into. Shader compilation is minimised and reduced within single `.pmfx` files by sharing and re-using binaries which are identical across different shader permitations or stages.

Descriptor layout and Vertex layout can be automatically generated based on resource usage inside shaders, the whole pipeline is exported as `.json` along with the built shaders. Hashes for the various pieces of the render pipline states are stored so you can quickly check for pipelines that may need rebuilding as part of a hot reloading process.
